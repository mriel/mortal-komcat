        <p><p>This is Crush and she has an undeveloped eyeball. That has nothing to do with the fact that I stole some poor dude’s work mace but karma got me back big time and I have totally been scared straight and I’m calling it even with life so come adopt this little cat who is around 2/3 and can be adopted alone because we have a floor full of cats who would be super stoked to go home alone to a wonderfully competent adult who has no time for such juvenile shenanigans or thievery.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2019/01/20/florence.html">Florence</a></h2>
        <p><p>This is Florence. Flo is that woman. Soft and loving, all she wants to do is chill hard with someone while you millennial weirdos binge watch shows on your laptop and stuff your face with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and quinoa salads. Flo wants nothing more than your lap and to stare lovingly at your stunning face. So if you’re looking for a slightly unhealthy relationship with a co-dependent woman desperate to love up on your warm crotch and keep you as her own, slide on down to the Catcade Superstore of Co-dependent Lovers and get a Flo in your life.</p>
