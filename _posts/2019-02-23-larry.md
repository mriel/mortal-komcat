This is Crush and she has an undeveloped eyeball. That has nothing to do with the fact that I stole some poor dude’s work mace but karma got me back big time and I have totally been scared straight and I’m calling it even with life so come adopt this little cat who is around 2/3 and can be adopted alone because we have a floor full of cats who would be super stoked to go home alone to a wonderfully competent adult who has no time for such juvenile shenanigans or thievery.
